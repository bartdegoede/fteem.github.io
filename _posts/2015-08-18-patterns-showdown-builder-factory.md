I will start with a disclaimer: although the title might lead you to think that it's
going to be a super exciting post, I assure you design patterns are not that exciting. 
They are useful, but I wouldn't count on them pumping up my adrenaline. 

Anyway, I have met a lot of people that do not know the differences between the
builder and the factory pattern and where to apply them. Let's revisit their definitions, 
see some every-day usecases that would be a nice fit for these patterns and discover
their differences.
